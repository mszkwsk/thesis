This is my enginnering thesis. Also a playground for using next.js. And react hooks of course.

And as a disclaimer. It's more of a POC or a prototype than appropriate solution. It will be one time presented only, so there will be some dirty hacks here and strange solutions.

Client is a prerendering service handle via next.js

Backend is a simple express app returning some data via rest api.
